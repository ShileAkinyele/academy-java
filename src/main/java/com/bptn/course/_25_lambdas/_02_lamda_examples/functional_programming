Functional Programming (As of Java 8)

Programming Style where we specify logic using functions (lambdas).
This programming style is based formal system in mathematical logic called LambdaCalculus

(JavaSript: Arrow Functions)


F:  A -> B

Note.- Everything that we can do with functional programming can be done with object oriented
       programming.
       We can use OOP and functional programming in the same program. So they coexist.


Benefits.- In some situations, functional programming makes your code more compact, cleaner, maintenable, nicer. But
that is not always the case. Lambda Expressions can be used to pass code around.

Functions vs Methods
********************

Functions- Are blocks of code that we can call that don't depend on an Object.

Methods - Are blocks of code that we can call that depend on a
