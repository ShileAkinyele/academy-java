//Time and Space Complexity

//Time Complexity: Tells us about the efficiency of an algorithm when the size of the
//input becomes enormous.

//Space Complexity: Tells us about the memory used by an algorithm when the size of the
//input becomes enormous.


//We use Big O notation to express the Time and Space Complexity.

//Common Big O complexities
//*************************

//O(1) - Constant - No matter the size of the input the algorithm always take the 
                 // same amount of time to process.
//                  E.g. The get() method of the HashMap class. 

//O(log n) - Logarithmic - BinarySearch

//O(n) - Linear - Search for a value in an array.

//O(n log n) - Quick Sort, Merge Sort 

//O(n^2) - quadratic - 2 nested for loops - Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort

        // for(){
         //   for(){
            
        //    }
       //  }   

//O(2^n) - exponential
